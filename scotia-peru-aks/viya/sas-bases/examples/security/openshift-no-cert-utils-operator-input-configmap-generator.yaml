## Example ConfigMapGenerator to generate the ConfigMap containing customer provided ingress certificate, key and CA certificate.
## Note that the ConfigMap generated by this file is only used for Kustomize processing and will not be deployed to Kubernetes. The 'config.kubernetes.io/local-config: "true"' annotation precludes it from the final list of resources.
##
## In the following code, the locations that require user specified values are indicated by a capitalized and
## hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. You should replace this token with the
## actual value.
## Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, "{{ INGRESS_SERVER_CERTIFICATE }}"
## should be replaced by the path to a .crt file containing your ingress server certificate(s).
## If you use the suggested example, the correct, final syntax would be:
## - certificate=site-config/security/tls.crt
##
