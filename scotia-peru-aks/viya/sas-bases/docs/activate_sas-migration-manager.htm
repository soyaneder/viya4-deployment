<h2 id="139641629210176overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The SAS Migration Management service interacts with SAS 9 Content Assessment to
migrate applicable content from a SAS 9 system to SAS Viya 4.</p>
<pre><code>  The SAS Migration Management service accesses and maintains information about SAS 9 objects and their statuses in the migration process.

  The SAS Migration Management service provides the following functions:

  1. Upload content from the SAS 9 system captured by SAS Content Assessment.
  2. Upload profiling information for an object.
  3. Upload code check information for an object.
  4. Update or append objects to the content.
  5. List content based on a filter.
  6. Create migration projects to subset content to be assessed by SAS Content Assessment.
  7. Maintain migration projects, including adding and deleting content based on a filter.
  8. Download migration project scripts as a ZIP file
  9. Log migration events.
</code></pre>
<p>The sas-migration-manager, microservice is deployed in an idle state (scale=0)
by default to save resources in Viya unless the user wants to use the migration
manager. In order to use the migration manager service it will have to be
activated in a deployment. To activate sas-migration-manager follow the
installation steps in this document.</p>
